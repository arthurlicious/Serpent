Serpent social enterprise intends to operate an online web-based attendance page that allows teachers to mark attendance for his classesâ€™ students. The online attendance page will be developed in-house by a team of talented student developers. Serpent social enterprise is a non-profit organization, where most donations come from philanthropic organizations, the donations are accountable for maintaining the business operations and all its resources. We believe that every dollar will be put to good use to increase the productivity in a classroom and create a better experience for teachers and students.
